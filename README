A simple obj file loader.

Does not mess with mtl loading.

Benefits:

If the file holds quad it will convert them to triangles

remaps loaded positions/normals/texcoords into a unique set of vertices to be used right away.

returns the positions/normals/texcoords as seperate float arrays so there is no need to convert form a custom data type to your data type.
